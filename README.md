# Arithmacellerator
Made for a FinCode hackathon, this project aims to repackage arithmetic learning for KS2 students. With decreasing attention spans, more distractions, the orthodox ways to learn simply will not work anymore! Discover a novel approach where fun meets learning and kids learn arithmetic through a fun racing game!
